# Project Title: 
### National heart disease in correlation to education and income level 

# Description: 
### Allow user to input location and determine how education and income level will affect heart disease rate

# Data: 
* https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml
* https://wonder.cdc.gov/

# 3-5 Initial research questions: 
* How to filter through all available data and select desired data set?
	* Cleaned data to show same range (2012-2016 County Level)
* What resulting data will be available for end-user?
	* County level mortality rate from heart disease, education level (less than highschool, highschool only, some college, Bachelor or higher), median household income.
* How do we want to display the data?
	* At county level, how mortality rate from heart disease ties to income and education level
				
# Techniques & tools: 
## Python API, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Geopandas, Joypy etc.

# Data Short comings: 
### The data provides an estimate based on education/income level, but one cannot assume that heart diseases can be prevented by education or income alone. While education or income may help prevent heart diseases and mortality from the diseases, many outside factors will and can contribute to overall heart disease rate.
