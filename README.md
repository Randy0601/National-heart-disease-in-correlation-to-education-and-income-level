Project Title: National heart disease in correlation to education and income level 
Description: Allow user to input location and determine how education and income level will affect heart disease rate
Data: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml
	https://wonder.cdc.gov/

3-5 Initial research questions: How to filter through all available data and select desired data set?
				What resulting data will be available for end-user?
				How do we want to display the data?
Techniques & tools: Python API, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.
Data Short comings: The data provides an estimate based on education/income level, but one cannot assume that heart diseases can be prevented by education or income alone. While education or income may help prevent heart diseases and mortality from the diseases, many outside factors will and can contribute to overall heart disease rate.
